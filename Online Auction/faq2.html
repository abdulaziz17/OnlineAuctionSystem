<h3>How does  auctions work?
</h3></div>
  <div id="answer">
    <p>
Registered online auction system users compete each other to win items. The price of the item starts at Rs.0/- and the auction clock starts counting down. Each time a bid is placed, the price of the item increases by a set amount and the auction clock's time gets reset. Once you place a bid, you’re in the lead until the auction clock runs out or someone else places a bid. When the auction clock reaches 0:00 and no more bids are received, the auction is over and the last person who bids wins the auction. winning price and winner's user ID is shown over that closed auction.    </p>
